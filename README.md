# Code Samples

The zodiac snippet shows a small portion of parsing dates from raw user input. It provides typing prediction when someone doesn't finish the sign name ('taur' instead of the correct 'taurus'), spelling correction ('cancre' instead of 'cancer'), and dynamic errors if a person inputs the unexpected patterns.

The react snippet is a class for a general form that sorts information which is acquired from an AJAX request on the component mounting.
